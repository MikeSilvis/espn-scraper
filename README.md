# ESPN Scraper

ESPN Scraper is a simple gem for scraping teams and scores from `ESPN`'s website. Please note that `ESPN` is not involved with this gem or me in any way. I chose `ESPN` because it is a leader in sports statistics and has a robust website. 


```ruby
ESPN.responding?
# => true
```

Lets begin...

#### Open console with the gem required

``` bash
$  rake espn_scraper:console
```

#### Supported leagues

The gem only supports the following leagues:

```ruby
ESPN.leagues
# => [ "nfl", "mlb", "nba", "nhl", "ncf", "ncb" ]
```

Which are the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, NCAA D1 Football, NCAA D1 Men's Basketball respectively.

#### Scrape Divisions

You can get all the divisions in each league.

```ruby
ESPN::Division.find(ESPN::NHL)
# => [
# 		 "Central Division",
# 		 "Pacific Division",
# 		 "Atlantic Division", 
# 		 "Metropolitan Division"
# 	 ]
```

#### Scrape teams

You can get the teams in each league by acronym. It returns a hash of each division with an array of hashes for each team in the division.

```ruby
ESPN::Team.find(ESPN::NBA)
# => {
#   "atlantic"=> [ 
#     { :name => "Boston Celtics", :data_name => "bos" },  
#     { :name => "Brooklyn Nets", :data_name => "bkn" }, 
#     { :name => "New York Knicks", :data_name => "ny" }, 
#     { :name => "Philadelphia 76ers", :data_name => "phi" }, 
#     { :name => "Toronto Raptors", :data_name => "tor" }
#   ]
#   "pacific" => ...
# }
```

#### Scraping scores



You'll notice the teams are identified with the same `:data_name` and is ESPN's unique identifier

``` ruby 
ESPN::Score.find(ESPN::NBA, Date.today)
# => [
#  {
#    :game_date=>Wed, 18 Mar 2015,
#    :home_team=>"cle",
#    :home_team_name=>"Cavaliers",
#    :away_team=>"bkn",
#    :away_team_name=>"Nets",
#    :home_score=>0,
#    :away_score=>0,
#    :home_team_rank=>"",
#    :away_team_rank=>"",
#    :home_team_record=>"43-26",
#    :away_team_record=>"27-38",
#    :state=>"pregame",
#    :start_time=>"7:00 PM ET",
#    :preview=>"400579297",
#    :line=>"",
#    :league=>"nba"
#  },
#  {
#    :game_date=>Wed, 18 Mar 2015,
#    :home_team=>"phi",
#    :home_team_name=>"76ers",
#    :away_team=>"det",
#    :away_team_name=>"Pistons",
#    :home_score=>0,
#    :away_score=>0,
#    :home_team_rank=>"",
#    :away_team_rank=>"",
#    :home_team_record=>"15-52",
#    :away_team_record=>"24-43",
#    :state=>"pregame",
#    :start_time=>"7:00 PM ET",
#    :preview=>"400579298",
#    :line=>"",
#    :league=>"nba"
#  }
#]

 ```
 
#### Scraping Boxscores

For more detailed information about a particular game you may want to see who scored, penalties, game location, etc.

``` ruby
ESPN::Boxscore.find(ESPN::NHL, 400564477)
# => {

#       }
#   ]
# }
```

#### Caching

You may have noticed that some requests can be extremely slow because they are making multiple get requests to ESPN.com for the data needed. Because of this there is a built in cache mechanism that uses just in memory store. If you are using a rails app or have memcache available to you I highly recommend using that instead. 

##### Rails
In an initializer

``` ruby
ESPN::Cache.client = Rails.cache

```

##### Ruby

If you aren't using rails, you can still write your own memory store using memcache. All you need to do is create a class that abides by `fetch(cache_key, attrs, &block)`, `read(cache_key)`, `write(cache_key, data, attrs = {})`, `clear(key)`

## Installing

Add the gem to your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'espn_scraper', git: 'git://github.com/aj0strow/espn-scraper.git'
# or
gem 'espn_scraper', github: 'aj0strow/espn-scraper'
```

..and then require it. I personally use it in rake tasks of a Rails app.

```ruby
require 'espn_scraper'
```

## Contributing

Please report back if something breaks on you!

Also please let me know if any of the data names get outdated. For instance a bunch of NFL data names were recently changed. You can make fixes temporarily with the following:

```ruby
ESPN::DATA_NAME_FIXES['nfl']['gnb'] = 'gb'
```

Future plans:
- Get start and end dates of a season
